# 🎥 Multimodal Video-to-Blog Pipeline

This organization hosts a modular system that transforms raw video content into structured, publish-ready blog posts using both audio and visual cues.

## 🔧 Functionality Overview

The pipeline consists of several stages that work together to extract, align, and summarize multimedia content:

1. **Raw Video Input**  
   Handles ingestion, validation, and optional annotation of video files.

2. **Audio Transcription** *(this repo)*  
   Extracts audio and generates timestamped transcripts using speech-to-text models.

3. **Visual Extraction Engine**  
   Performs scene detection, OCR, keyframe extraction, visual tagging, and captioning.

4. **Multimodal Alignment**  
   Synchronizes transcript segments with visual data using timestamps.

5. **Summary Generation**  
   Uses an LLM to generate a blog-style summary enriched with contextual visuals.

6. **Blog Post Builder**  
   Formats the summarized content into a styled blog post draft.

7. **Preview & Export**  
   Final manual editing and publishing to blogging platforms.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each task in the pipeline is implemented as a standalone repo in this organization, ensuring clear separation of concerns and modular development.

## 📌 Note

This README describes the overall workflow. Refer to individual repositories (e.g., Audio Transcription) for task-specific implementations as development progresses.
